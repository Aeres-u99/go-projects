### Eleven go projects

A video by freecodecamp showed few basic golang projects, which kinda seemed interesting.
So here I am, on my own little whim, sitting down and trying to follow along the tutorials, to get my feet wet 
Projects are as follows:

1. go-server:
  * Checkout the diagram.md for an idea on how its "designed"
  * check the notes maybe?
  * Nothing special.
2. go-movies-crud
