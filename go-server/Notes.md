### Notes

1. Basic stuffs
2. We create fileserver that analyzes static folder to serve files from
3. then for each route we define the handler function
4. each of these handler functions take two params,
  1. Write Reasponse: what to write to them :D
  2. Read request: what are they asking for
5. We operate on 2 and return 1.
and this is done :D
